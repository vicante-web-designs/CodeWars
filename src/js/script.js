// Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

// For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

function updateLight(current) {
  if(current === 'yellow'){
    return 'red'
  }else if(current === 'red'){
    return 'green'
  }else {

// You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
// If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

// Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output):

// 6, 10 --> 32
// 3, 3 --> 9
// Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.

const areaOrPerimeter = (l , w) => l === w ? l * w : 2 * (l + w)

// Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

// Examples:

// Inputs: "abc", "bc"
// Output: true

// Inputs: "abc", "d"
// Output: false

// The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

// For example:

// 1.08 --> 30
// Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.

const cockroachSpeed = s => Math.floor((s * 100000)/3600)

// Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.

// a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.

// The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".

// A few examples:(Input1, Input2, Input3 --> Output)

// 5, 2, "add"      --> 7
// 5, 2, "subtract" --> 3
// 5, 2, "multiply" --> 10
// 5, 2, "divide"   --> 2.5
// Try to do it without using if statements!

function arithmetic(a, b, operator){
  let signs = {
    add: '+',
    subtract: '-',
    multiply: '*',
    divide: '/'

// The Story:
// Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.

// Task Overview:
// You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

// cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
// on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
// wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
// If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

// Usage Examples:
// cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
// cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting
// Fundamentals

const enough = (cap,on,wait) => (on + wait) > cap ? Math.abs(wait - (cap - on)) : 0

// As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

// The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

// For example:

// gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0
// 2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.

// Another example (just to make sure it is clear):

// gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1
// 10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is 1.

function gimme (triplet) {
  const min = Math.min(...triplet)
  const max = Math.max(...triplet)

  const middleNum = triplet.filter(x => x !== min && x !== max)

  return triplet.indexOf(...middleNum)

}

Example
